### Testing task 2 code:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.

require_relative('card.rb')
class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card.name
  else
    card2
  end
end
end

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
end

  #11 - Correct to "=="
  #18 - Spelling, should be spelled def
  #18 - comma required between the two passed parameters
  #19 - .name does not exist
  #20 - 'card' is not a variable, return statement required
  #22 - Variable with no return or method called
  #26 - variable cards does not exists, calling self does not require variable to be passed in
  #27 - total does not equal anything
  #25 - redundant end expression
  #28 - total is undefined
  #30 - Can pass total within string
  #31 - Add space at end of string to avoid "...ofxx"
